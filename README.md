## Features

* Simultaneously view and manage stories across multiple projects
* Scrum-like UI displays one column per story state, including "In QA" and "Passed QA"
* Search across all projects simultaneously
* Quickly drill down using any combination of projects, labels, users, and searches
* All labels for all projects are visible and have epic-like mini progress charts
* Columns can be rearranged
* Labels, searches, column order, selected projects all survive browser restart
* Enter your Pivotal API token and user name and off you go
* Most actions are supported: update story descriptions, add notes, drag them to different columns to update their status and priority
* It's pretty easy to write custom columns and filters
* Forecasting charts

## Who Is This For?

Companies like [a particular technology startup](http://www.intentmedia.com/) that use Pivotal Tracker and have multiple small projects going at once, but no good way to visualize and track progress across them all.

## Project Status

This should be considered beta software, use at your own risk. If you have any issues or feature requests, we would love to know, please [open an issue](http://github.com/intentmedia/TrackerTracker/issues). Contributions and pull requests are also very welcome.

## Demo

A demo install is up and running at [http://trackertracker.glomerate.com](http://trackertracker.glomerate.com). API tokens are not logged by the server. The only thing exposed in the server logs are project IDs, which are useless without proper access to them.

## Installation

npm -g install grunt
npm -g install forever

npm install
grunt
cd app
forever start --watch -l ~/forever.log -o ~/out.log -e ~/err.log app.js
```

```

## Browser Support

TrackerTracker is tested and built for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox stable. It seems fine in IE 9, but broken in IE 10. (Progress!) Fluid's localStorage implementation doesn't survive a restart, so for now Fluid should be considered unsupported.
